                        a museum, or battlefield, my parents always tried to teach us something about the world. Here we <br> are meeting Paul Tibbets. He was the pilot of the Enola Gay, which 
                        dropped the first atomic bomb <br> on Hiroshima. In this photograph, he is reading a story that my brother wrote for his homework about <br> World War II. 
                        Paul Tibbets liked it so much he asked if he could keep it. We of course said yes, and <br> when my brother went to school the next day, 
                        his teacher asked for his homework. "I don't have it," he says. <br> "Paul Tibbets took it from me." As a history teacher myself, that is the only valid excuse I would accept!</p>

            <p id="Fencing2Text">As a 12th grade teacher, my students always ask me what piece of advice I would give<br>them as college freshmen. My answer is always the same: joining a sports team, or a<br>club, or just any campus group or organization, is the abolsute best way to make<br>friends. Some of my most memorable experiences in college are from the Fencing Team,<br>and all of my closest friends are from the team as well. We practiced together four times<br>per week, traveled the country for tournaments, and always hung out together. If you do<br> nothing else in college, join a team, club, or social group - it'll be the best choice you can<br>ever make. Because no college student ever left a lecture hall and said, "Man, that was<br>so much fun!" :)<strong> En Garde!!</strong></p>

        <p id="Section_3_Text">Part of the advice I give my students is that, while your studies are certainly important, it's your college experiences and friends that you will actually remember.
            To that end, I always recommend to my students that they study abroad. My first experience doing so was a short trip to Munich, and then a semester at the University of Mannheim.
            I can't fully express how grateful I am for that experience. Not only did my German become much better, but I studied with other students from the University of Florida. Before the trip, we didn't know each other. 
            After the trip, it felt like we had known each other for years. We still keep in touch, and I'm going to a wedding for one of them in a few weeks. Will I be dressed in Lederhosen for this wedding? Aber natürlich! :)</p>

        <p id="Section_4_Text">When I finished my undergraduate studies, I began graduate school at the University of Munich. I was fortunate enough to receive a 1-year scholarship, and also to live in a German dormitory. From this, I was able to not only sharpen my lanague skills, but I met German, Polish, French, Italian, Danish, English, Norwegian, Scottish, and Finnish students. We all became good friends, and I was invited to visit them during the semester breaks. I feel very lucky to have traveled so much during this time, and the friendships that I developed are still holding strong today. Again, my biggest piece of advice to all students: study abroad, meet people, get out there and see the world. It's waiting for you :) </p>

            <h2 id="Section_6_Header">Travels & Adventures</h2> 

            <p id="travelParagraph">Because travel has shaped who I am, I decided it deserves its own section. Every time I travel, I learn something new about the world, about people, and about myself, and I return changed in some way. Below you can see a small sampling of my travels and adventures. You'll notice that the vast majority are travels to Europe. I usually travel alone, and given the choice of destinations, I always end up back in Europe. This happens because I try to make time to see the friends I made while studying there. And so, whenever I'm planning a trip, Europe is usually the first thing on my mind. I would like to explore other parts of the world, but there's still time for that. Until then, I hope you enjoy the tales and stories below.</p>

        <p>As a teacher, I am always asking my students what they have learned. But sometimes I need to step back and ask myself that very same question. In all of my life experiences, I think one important thing stands out the most.<br>
        <br>
        Find what makes you happy, and keep doing it. We all have jobs, they stress us out, and life will do that as well. But try as best you can to stay focused on what brings you joy, and where your happy place is. The more time you spend in your happy place, the better your life will be.<br> 
        <br>
        Because at the end of a day, a week, a year, and a life, that's all that's going to matter.</p>
